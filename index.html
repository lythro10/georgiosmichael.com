            <h2>CV of Georgios Michael</h2>

            <p class="part_one">
                My fascination with technology was sparked when, as a child I thought it would be a great idea to take apart my Xbox console to customize the firmware so it would be able to play unsupported games. Aware of the danger, I was still eager to see how it all worked inside. I find it intriguing how fast society has been shaped and continues to be, by the influence of Computer Science. A few years ago if someone were to have claimed that cars would become autonomous, people would have doubted them. Now we are at a stage where nearly anything is possible and this is due to the relentless problem solving of computer scientists. I want to study Computer Science because I want to gain the knowledge needed to be able to help find solutions to world problems, with the efficient use of computer technology. With the knowledge and skills, I will attain from this course, the creative ideas that I could bring into fruition would be endless. I hope to become one of the computer scientists who adapt technology for autonomous driving. One possibility would be for artificially intelligent technology to be applied to existing and future motor vehicles to make them safer on the road and more convenient for their drivers

                <p>I have been teaching myself Web Development in my spare time and have completed online programming courses. One of the courses is Build Websites from Scratch which is taught by CodeCademy Pro Intensive covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github , which have allowed me to explore the endless possibilities that computer science can bring to the world. I have also learnt to create a simple iOS face recognition with the use of public libraries and with the use of application programming interface using Apple’s syntax called ‘Swift’, in XCode.</p>
